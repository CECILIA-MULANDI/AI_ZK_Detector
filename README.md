# AI_ZK_Detector

# my-dapp is a zk_app that is used to detect if an image is AI generated or not!

- It runs a hugging face AI model in the AI-image-detector which helps classify the image and give scores to determine if the image is AI generated or not.
- The result of this is fed into a noir circuit that is run by a proving backend to generate proofs and verify them
